                <h2>The Nine Federally Recognized Tribes</h2>
                There are nine federally recognized Tribes in the State of Oregon. The reconized tribes include
                <ul>
                  <li> Burns Paiute Tribe </li>
                  <li> Confederated Tribs of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians </li>
                  <li> Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon </li>
                  <li> Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians </li>
                  <li> Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation </li>
                  <li> Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs </li>
                  <li> Coquille Indian Tribe </li>
                  <li> Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians </li>
                  <li> Klamath Tribes </li>
                </ul>
                 Most of the Tribes are confederations
                which means that the within each confederation there are many different bands and smaller tribes that were
                grouped together to form one large tribe. These confederates were granted lands known as reservations which were
                granted to the Tribes in exchange for their homeland. Every Oregon Tribe experienced forced removal by the federal
                government in order to steal the resource rich land of a disenfranchised people. I am a member of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians
                so the rest of this story map is focused on the Siletz people.

                <h2>Dvh-Nee</h2>
                The multiple bands and Tribes that make up the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians come from the Columbian River down into northern California and from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Cascades in the east were sent
                at different times to the reservation that is today known as the Siletz Reservation. My ancestors who were were later grouped into the Tututni lived in the Rouge/Chetco river areas of southwest oregon. The term dvh-nee, pronouced duh-nae, is what
                the people called home. There isn't really a english translation to the word that does it justice but eloquently speaking it is where the people come from, where they are, and where they should always be. Like with most indigenous Tribes
                my ancestors were deeply connected with the land they occupied. It gave them life, food, water, and shelter were abundant in every direction pre-european contact. The people honored the land and held ceremonies to give thanks and pray for
                upcoming harvest to be bountiful. The people lived with the cycles of the land and moved from winter to summer villages to stay close to the food sources which were salmon, big game, and seafood. The Chetco river country is beautiful and
                going back there I understand why my ancestors fought so hard before eventually being forced onto reservations.

                <h2>The Siletz Reservation</h2>
                The original reservation set aside for the Siletz people by President Pierce on November 9, 1855 was 1.1 million acres and was traded for approximately
                19 million acres that the tribes originally inhabited. After the people were relocated to the Siletz reservation the treaties were ignored by the americans and by 1875
                more than 900,000 acres had been taken from the Siletz without regard to treaties already in place. The 1887 Allotment Act was a further attack on the land holdings of the Siletz
                by parceling out what was left to living tribal members they were able to take the rest of the land because the living members had already been alloted their parcel. The rest of the land was taken and now is what is known
                as Lincoln County. The modern Siletz reservation consists of patchwork lands across lincoln county and tribal membership is around 5,100 people.

                        Web Mapping provided by Oregon State University. The story map library is derived from the

                        relies on both leaflet and Boostrap.</p>
